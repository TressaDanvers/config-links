# Security Policy

## Support

Software is provided as-is, as stated in the license. However, if you report a security vulnerability
I am inclined to assess it as I (will) use this software myself.

## Supported Versions

As there are no release versions as of yet, no support shall be given. If you see a vulnerability report it,
but don't expect anything timely.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not report a vulnerability as a bug report; file it as a security advisory.
